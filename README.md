# Titanic-Dataset

This repository contains a Kaggle notebook that explores the Titanic dataset, which is a popular dataset for binary classification problems in machine learning. The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more.

NOTEBOOK OVERVIEW

The notebook covers the following steps:

1. Data Loading and Exploration:

   Importing the dataset from Kaggle.
   Overview of the dataset features and understanding the target variable.
  
2. Data Preprocessing:

   Handling missing values (e.g., in Age, Cabin).
   Encoding categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Embarked).
   Feature engineering (e.g., creating new features based on existing ones).
   
3. Data Visualization:

   Visualizing the relationships between features and survival rate using plots.
   Insights into how different factors (like gender, class) affect the survival probability.
   
4. Model Building:

   Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
   Implementing various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and others.
   Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   
5. Hyperparameter Tuning:

   Fine-tuning the best-performing model using techniques like Grid Search or Randomized Search.
   
Conclusion:
Final evaluation of the model.
Summary of key insights and results.

DATASET

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including:

1. PassengerId
2. Survived (target variable)
3. Pclass (ticket class)
4. Name
5. Sex
6. Age
7. SibSp (siblings/spouses aboard)
8. Parch (parents/children aboard)
9. Ticket
10. Fare
11. Cabin
12. Embarked (port of embarkation)
    
You can download the dataset from Kaggle Titanic Dataset.

RESULTS

The notebook explores different machine learning models, with a focus on improving prediction accuracy. The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set.
